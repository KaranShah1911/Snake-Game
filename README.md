SNAKE GAME 🐍🐍🐍

This is a very interesting and old game which first appeared in Nokia Mobile phones.

Snake game is a classic arcade-style game where players control a growing snake, navigating it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own tail. 
The objective is to achieve the highest score by consuming as much food as possible, causing the snake to grow longer and the game to become more challenging. 
It’s a fun and addictive game that tests players’ reflexes and strategic thinking.

After clicking the run button, a pop will appear and the game will start immediately. So be a little <strong>Alert</strong>
- Game will be terminated when the snakes touches its own tail or boundry line.
- Your final score will be on the top of the screen. It will be based on the amount of food consumed by your snake 🐍🐍


Also, i have added the feature of HIGH SCORE. Your high score, whenever you've made will be displayed when you start playing again.

Whenever you hit the borders or any part of the tail of the snake the game will restart immediately.

The game has no end feature i.e if you want to stop playing you have just close the window.
